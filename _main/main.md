# Awesome WM Widgets

This is a project page of the github repo with set of widgets for Awesome Window Manager

## Prerequisite

To have a consistent color palette through all the widgets add following section to your **theme.lua**. This will also allow you to easily change colors of the widgets in one place.

```lua
-- https://github.com/streetturtle/awesome-wm-widget
theme.widget_main_color = "#74aeab"
theme.widget_red = "#e53935"
theme.widget_yelow = "#c0ca33"
theme.widget_green = "#43a047"
theme.widget_black = "#000000"
theme.widget_transparent = "#00000000"
```
