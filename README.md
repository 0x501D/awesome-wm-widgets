These widgets use [Arc icon theme](https://github.com/horst3180/arc-icon-theme) by default but it could be easily 
changed to any other icon theme. If you want to have separators between widgets like on the screenshot create text widget with ` : ` and place it between widgets:

```lua
...
sprtr = wibox.widget.textbox()
sprtr:set_text(" : ")
...
sprtr,
volume_icon,
sprtr,
battery_widget,
sprtr,
...
```

# Installation

[Install](https://github.com/horst3180/arc-icon-theme#installation) Arc icon theme and follow installation instructions of each widget.

Or you can clone this repo under **~/.config/awesome/** and then add widgets you'd like to use in wibox:

```bash
cd ~/.config/awesome/
git clone https://github.com/streetturtle/awesome-wm-widgets.git
```

and in **rc.lua**

```lua
require("awesome-wm-widgets.battery-widget.battery")
...
 -- Add widgets to the wibox
     s.mywibox:setup {
         layout = wibox.layout.align.horizontal,
         { -- Left widgets
         ...
         },
         s.mytasklist, -- Middle widget
         { -- Right widgets
         ...
             battery_widget,
         ...
         }
```

# Icons

If you don't want to install Arc icon theme you can just download the icons which are used from the [Arc repository](https://github.com/horst3180/arc-theme).
Or create your own icons with the same name.
